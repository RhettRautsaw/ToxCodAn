Tutorial
========

A quick tutorial to use Venomancer.

- Download the [Mfulv.fasta](https://github.com/pedronachtigall/Venomancer/blob/master/tutorial/Mfulv.fasta) file. The Mfulv dataset is the curated transcriptome available at the TSA database generated by the run SRR630454 available at the SRA database.

- Download the [models.zip](https://github.com/pedronachtigall/Venomancer/blob/master/models.zip) file and uncompress the file (```unzip models.zip```).

Running Venomancer
==================

Basic usage:
```
venomancer.py -t Mfulv.fasta -m models/
```

The user can set several optional parameters to run Venomancer as desired:

- ```-s string``` -> sample ID to be used in the output files [default = venomancer]
- ```-o folder``` -> name and path to the output folder [default = "Venomancer_output"]
- ```-p boolean value``` -> set "True" to turn on or "False" to turn off the signalP filter [default = True]
- ```-c int``` -> number of threads to be used in the analysis [default = 1], setting up more threads will decrease the running time of Venomancer.
- ```-f int``` -> threshold value used as the minimum coverage in the pre-filter step [default = 90]
- ```-F int``` -> threshold value used as the minimum coverage in the toxin filter step [default = 80]


:warning:**Warning**:warning:

We strongly recommend to use the default options but paying attention to the ```-c``` option, which will decrease the running time of Venomancer proportionally as the number of threads being used.
